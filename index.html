      <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>I am a front end web developer with 5+ years of experience in commercial Node.js application development. Expert in styling and scripting, I have applied my skills to all stages of feature development, from requirement gathering to sign-off and deployment, in a professional environment. I believe in lively collaboration, high-performance scripting practices, rigorous testing standards, and development environments that encourage all of the above. I'd like to offer my skills to help you build something interesting.</p>
